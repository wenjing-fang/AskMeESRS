ESRS 1 - 1,"The objective of European Sustainability  Reporting Standards (ESRS) is to specify the sustainability information  that an undertaking shall disclose in accordance with  Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the  Council ( 1 ) , as amended by Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council. ( 2 ) Reporting in accordance with ESRS does not exempt undertakings from other obligations laid down in Union law.",paragraph,ESRS 1,,,Objective,,,1.
ESRS 1 - 2,"Specifically, ESRS specify the information that an undertaking shall disclose about its material impacts , risks and opportunities in relation to environmental, social, and governance sustainability matters. ESRS do not require undertakings to  disclose any information on environmental, social and governance topics  covered by ESRS when the undertaking has assessed the topic in question  as non-material (See Appendix E of this Standard “ Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included ”).The information disclosed in accordance with ESRS enables users of the sustainability statement to understand the undertaking’s  material impacts on people and environment and the material effects of  sustainability matters on the undertaking’s development, performance and  position.",paragraph,ESRS 1,,,Objective,,,2.
ESRS 1 - 3,"The objective of this Standard (ESRS 1) is  to provide an understanding of the architecture of ESRS, the drafting  conventions and fundamental concepts used, and the general requirements  for preparing and presenting sustainability information in accordance  with Directive 2013/34/EU, as amended by Directive  (EU) 2022/2464.",paragraph,ESRS 1,,,Objective,,,3.

ESRS 1(1.)(1),Categories of ESRS standards,title_subsection,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,1.1,
ESRS 1 - 4,"There are three categories of ESRS: (a) cross-cutting standards; (b) topical standards (Environmental, Social and Governance standards); and (c) sector-specific standards. Cross-cutting standards and  topical standards are sector-agnostic, meaning that they apply to all  undertakings regardless of which sector or sectors the undertaking  operates in.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,4.
ESRS 1 - 5,The cross-cutting standards ESRS 1 General requirements and ESRS 2 General disclosures apply to the sustainability matters covered by topical standards and sector-specific standards.,paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,5.
ESRS 1 - 6,"This standard (ESRS 1) describes the  architecture of ESRS standards, explains drafting conventions and  fundamental concepts, and sets out general requirements for preparing  and presenting sustainability-related information.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,6.
ESRS 1 - 7,"ESRS 2 establishes Disclosure Requirements  on the information that the undertaking shall provide at a general  level across all material sustainability matters on the reporting areas governance , strategy , impact, risk and opportunity management, and metrics and targets .",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,7.
ESRS 1 - 8,"Topical ESRS cover a sustainability topic  and are structured into topics and sub-topics, and where necessary  sub-sub-topics. The table in Application Requirement 16 (AR 16) to this  standard provides an overview of the sustainability topics, sub-topics  and sub-sub-topics (collectively ‘ sustainability matters ’) covered by topical ESRS.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,8.
ESRS 1 - 9,Topical ESRS can include specific  requirements that complement the general level Disclosure Requirements  of ESRS 2. ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures provides a list of the additional requirements in topical ESRS that the  undertaking shall apply in conjunction with the general level  disclosure requirements of ESRS 2.,paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,9.
ESRS 1 - 10,"Sector-specific standards are applicable to all undertakings within a sector. They address impacts, risks and opportunities that are likely to be material for  all undertakings in a specific sector and that are not covered, or not  sufficiently covered, by topical standards. Sector-specific standards  are multi-topical and cover the topics that are most relevant to the  sector in question. Sector-specific standards achieve a high degree of  comparability.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,10.
ESRS 1 - 11,"In addition to the disclosure requirements  laid down in the three categories of ESRS, when an undertaking  concludes that an impact, risk or opportunity is not covered or not  covered with sufficient granularity by an ESRS but is material due to  its specific facts and circumstances, it shall provide additional  entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the  undertaking’s sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities . Application requirements AR 1 to AR 5 provide further guidance regarding entity-specific disclosures.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.1,Categories of ESRS standards,,,11.

ESRS 1 - 12,"The Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2, in  topical ESRS and in sector-specific ESRS are structured into the  following reporting areas: (a) Governance (GOV): the governance processes, controls and procedures used to monitor, manage and oversee impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2, chapter 2 Governance ); (b) Strategy (SBM): how the undertaking’s strategy and business model interact with its  material impacts, risks and opportunities, including how the undertaking  addresses those impacts, risks and opportunities (see ESRS 2, chapter 3 Strategy ); (c) Impact, risk and opportunity management (IRO): the process(es) by which the undertaking: i. identifies impacts, risks and opportunities and assesses their materiality (see IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2), ii. manages material sustainability matters through policies and actions (see section 4.2 of ESRS 2). (d) Metrics and targets (MT): the undertaking’s performance, including targets it has set and progress towards meeting them (see ESRS 2, chapter 5 Metrics and targets ).",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.2,"Reporting areas and minimum content disclosure requirements on policies, actions, targets and metrics",,,12.
ESRS 1 - 13,"ESRS 2 includes: (a) in section 4.2 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding policies (MDR-P) and actions (MDR-A); (b) in section 5 Minimum Disclosure Requirements regarding metrics (MDR-M) and targets (MDR-T).

ESRS 1(1.)(1),Drafting conventions,title_subsection,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,1.3,
ESRS 1 - 14,"In all ESRS: (a) the term “ impacts ” refers to positive and  negative sustainability-related impacts that are connected with the  undertaking’s business, as identified through an impact materiality assessment (see section 3.4 Impact materiality ). It refers both to actual impacts and to potential future impacts. (b) The term “ risks and opportunities ” refers to the  undertaking’s sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities,  including those deriving from dependencies on natural, human and social  resources, as identified through a financial materiality assessment (see section 3.5). Collectively, these are referred to as “impacts, risks and opportunities” (IROs). They reflect the double materiality perspective of ESRS described in section 3.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,,14.
ESRS 1 - 15,"Throughout ESRS, the terms that are defined in the glossary of definitions (Annex II) are put in bold italic , except when a defined term is used more than once in the same paragraph.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,,15.
ESRS 1 - 16,ESRS structure the information to be  disclosed under Disclosure Requirements. Each Disclosure Requirement  consists of one or more distinct datapoints. The term “datapoint” can  also refer to a narrative sub-element of a Disclosure Requirement.,paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,,16.
ESRS 1 - 17,In addition to Disclosure Requirements  most ESRS also contain Application Requirements. Application  Requirements support the application of Disclosure Requirements and have  the same authority as other parts of an ESRS.,paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,,17.
ESRS 1 - 18,"ESRS use the following terms to distinguish between different degrees of obligation on the undertaking to disclose information: (a) “shall disclose” – indicates that the provision is prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement or datapoint; (b) “may disclose” – indicates voluntary disclosure to encourage good practice. In addition, ESRS use the  term “shall consider” when referring to issues, resources or  methodologies that the undertaking is expected to take into account or  to use in the preparation of a given disclosure if applicable.",paragraph,ESRS 1,1.,1.3,Drafting conventions,,,18.
ESRS 1(2.),Qualitative characteristics of information,title_section,ESRS 1,2.,,,,2.,
ESRS 1 - 19,"When preparing its sustainability statement , the undertaking shall apply: (a) the fundamental qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. relevance and faithful representation; and (b) the enhancing qualitative characteristics of information, i.e. comparability, verifiability and understandability.",paragraph,ESRS 1,2.,,,,,19.
ESRS 1 - 20,These qualitative characteristics of information are defined and described in Appendix B of this Standard.,paragraph,ESRS 1,2.,,,,,20.
ESRS 1(3.),Double materiality as the basis for sustainability disclosures,title_section,ESRS 1,3.,,,,3.,

ESRS 1(3.)(3),Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.1,Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process,,3.1,
ESRS 1 - 22,"Stakeholders are those who can affect or be affected by the undertaking. There are two main groups of stakeholders: (a) affected  stakeholders: individuals or groups whose interests are affected or  could be affected – positively or negatively – by the undertaking’s  activities and its direct and indirect business relationships across its value chain ; and (b) users of sustainability statements : primary users of  general-purpose financial reporting (existing and potential investors,  lenders and other creditors, including asset managers, credit  institutions, insurance undertakings), and other users of sustainability  statements, including the undertaking’s business partners, trade unions  and social partners, civil society and non-governmental organisations,  governments, analysts and academics.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.1,Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process,,,22.
ESRS 1 - 23,"Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups referred to in paragraph 22.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.1,Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process,,,23.
ESRS 1 - 24,"Engagement with affected stakeholders is central to the undertaking’s on-going due diligence process (see chapter 4 Due diligence ) and sustainability materiality assessment. This includes its  processes to identify and assess actual and potential negative impacts,  which then inform the assessment process to identify the material  impacts for the purposes of sustainability reporting (see section 3.4 of  this Standard).",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.1,Stakeholders and their relevance to the materiality assessment process,,,24.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Material matters and materiality of information,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,3.2,
ESRS 1 - 25,"Performing a materiality assessment (see sections 3.4 Impact materiality and 3.5 Financial materiality ) is necessary for the undertaking to identify the material impacts, risks and opportunities to be reported.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,25.
ESRS 1 - 26,"Materiality assessment is the starting point for  sustainability reporting under ESRS. IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2,  includes general disclosure requirements about the undertaking’s process  to identify impacts, risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3  of ESRS 2 provides general disclosure requirements on the material  impacts, risks and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s  materiality assessment.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,26.
ESRS 1 - 27,"The Application Requirements in Appendix A of this Standard include a list of sustainability matters covered in topical ESRS, categorised by topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics, to support the materiality assessment. Appendix E Flowchart for determining disclosures to be included of this Standard provides an illustration of the materiality assessment described in this section.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,27.
ESRS 1 - 28,"A sustainability matter is “material” when it meets the criteria defined for impact materiality (see section 3.4 of this Standard) or financial materiality (see section 3.5 of this Standard), or both.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,28.
ESRS 1 - 29,"Irrespective of the outcome of its  materiality assessment, the undertaking shall always disclose the  information required by: ESRS 2 General Disclosures (i.e. all the Disclosure Requirements and data points specified in ESRS  2) and the Disclosure Requirements (including their datapoints) in  topical ESRS related to the Disclosure Requirement IRO-1 Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities , as listed in ESRS 2 Appendix C Disclosure/Application Requirements in topical ESRS that are applicable jointly with ESRS 2 General Disclosures .",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,29.
ESRS 1 - 30,"When the undertaking concludes that a sustainability matter is material as a result of its materiality assessment, on which ESRS 2 IRO-1, IRO-2 and SBM-3 set disclosure requirements, it shall: (a) disclose  information according to the Disclosure Requirements (including  Application Requirements) related to that specific sustainability matter  in the corresponding topical and sector-specific ESRS; and (b) disclose  additional entity-specific disclosures (see paragraph 11 and AR 1 to AR 5  of this Standard) when the material sustainability matter is not  covered by an ESRS or is covered with insufficient granularity.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,30.
ESRS 1 - 31,"The applicable information prescribed  within a Disclosure Requirement, including its datapoints, or an  entity-specific disclosure, shall be disclosed when the undertaking  assesses, as part of its assessment of material information, that the  information is relevant from one or more of the following perspectives: (a) the significance of the information in relation to the matter it purports to depict or explain; or (b) the capacity of  such information to meet the users’ decision-making needs, including  the needs of primary users of general-purpose financial reporting  described in paragraph 48 and/or the needs of users whose principal  interest is in information about the undertaking’s impacts.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,31.
ESRS 1 - 32,"If the undertaking concludes that climate change is not material and therefore omits all disclosure requirements in ESRS E1 Climate change , it shall disclose a detailed explanation of the conclusions of its materiality assessment with regard to climate change (see ESRS 2 IRO-2 Disclosure Requirements in ESRS covered by the undertaking’s sustainability statement ),  including a forward-looking analysis of the conditions that could lead  the undertaking to conclude that climate change is material in the  future. If the undertaking concludes that a topic other than climate  change is not material and therefore it omits all the Disclosure  Requirements in the corresponding topical ESRS, it may briefly explain  the conclusions of its materiality assessment for that topic.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,32.
ESRS 1 - 33,"When disclosing information on policies, actions and targets in relation to a sustainability matter that has been assessed to be  material, the undertaking shall include the information prescribed by  all the Disclosure Requirements and datapoints in the topical and  sector-specific ESRS related to that matter and in the corresponding Minimum Disclosure Requirement on policies, actions, and targets  required under ESRS 2. If the undertaking cannot disclose the  information prescribed by either the Disclosure Requirements and  datapoints in the topical or sector-specific ESRS, or the Minimum  Disclosure Requirements in ESRS 2 on policies, actions and targets,  because it has not adopted the respective policies, implemented the  respective actions or set the respective targets, it shall disclose this  to be the case and it may report a timeframe in which it aims to have  these in place.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,33.
ESRS 1 - 34,"When disclosing information on metrics for a material sustainability matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of the relevant topical ESRS, the undertaking: (a) shall include the information prescribed by a Disclosure Requirement if it assesses such information to be material; and (b) may omit the  information prescribed by a datapoint of a Disclosure Requirement if it  assesses such information to be not material and concludes that such  information is not needed to meet the objective of the Disclosure  Requirement.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,34.
ESRS 1 - 35,"If the undertaking omits the information  prescribed by a datapoint that derives from other EU legislation listed  in Appendix B of ESRS 2, it shall explicitly state that the information  in question is “not material”.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,35.
ESRS 1 - 36,"The undertaking shall establish how it applies criteria, including appropriate thresholds, to determine: (a) the information it discloses on metrics for a material  sustainability matter according to the Metrics and Targets section of  the relevant topical ESRS, in accordance with paragraph 34; and (b) the information to be disclosed as entity-specific disclosures.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.2,Material matters and materiality of information,,,36.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Double materiality,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,3.3,
ESRS 1 - 37,"Double materiality has two dimensions, namely: impact materiality and financial materiality . Unless specified otherwise, the terms “material” and “materiality” are used throughout ESRS to refer to double materiality.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,37.
ESRS 1 - 38,"Impact materiality and financial materiality assessments are inter-related and the  interdependencies between these two dimensions shall be considered. In  general, the starting point is the assessment of impacts, although there  may also be material risks and opportunities that are not related to the undertaking’s impacts . A sustainability impact may be  financially material from inception or become financially material, when  it could reasonably be expected to affect the undertaking’s financial  position, financial performance, cash flows, its access to finance or  cost of capital over the short-, medium- or long-term. Impacts are  captured by the impact materiality perspective irrespective of whether  or not they are financially material.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,38.
ESRS 1 - 39,"In identifying and assessing the impacts, risks and opportunities in the undertaking’s value chain to determine their materiality , the undertaking shall focus on areas  where impacts, risks and opportunities are deemed likely to arise,  based on the nature of the activities, business relationships,  geographies or other factors concerned.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,39.
ESRS 1 - 40,"The undertaking shall consider how it is affected by its dependencies on the availability of natural, human and social resources at appropriate prices and quality, irrespective of its potential impacts on those resources.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,40.
ESRS 1 - 41,"An undertaking’s principal impacts, risks and opportunities are understood to be the same as the material impacts, risks and opportunities identified under the double materiality principle and therefore reported on in its sustainability statement.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,41.
ESRS 1 - 42,"The undertaking shall apply the criteria  set under sections 3.4 and 3.5 in this Standard, using appropriate  quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds. Appropriate thresholds  are necessary to determine which impacts, risks and opportunities are identified and addressed by the undertaking as material and to determine which sustainability matters are material for reporting purposes.  Some existing standards and frameworks use the term ""most significant  impacts” when referring to the threshold used to identify the impacts  that are described in ESRS as ""material impacts.""",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.3,Double materiality,,,42.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Impact materiality,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.4,Impact materiality,,3.4,
ESRS 1 - 43,"A sustainability matter is material from an impact  perspective when it pertains to the undertaking’s material actual or  potential, positive or negative impacts on people or the environment over the  short-, medium- or long-term. Impacts include those connected with the  undertaking’s own operations and upstream and downstream value chain,  including through its products and services, as well as through its  business relationships. Business relationships include those in the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain and are not limited to direct contractual relationships.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.4,Impact materiality,,,43.
ESRS 1 - 44,"In this context, impacts on people or the  environment include impacts in relation to environmental, social and  governance matters.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.4,Impact materiality,,,44.
ESRS 1 - 45,"The materiality assessment of a negative impact is  informed by the due diligence process defined in the international  instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. For actual  negative impacts, materiality is based on the severity of the impact,  while for potential negative impacts it is based on the severity and  likelihood of the impact. Severity is based on the following factors: (a) the scale; (b) scope; and (c) irremediable character of the impact. In the case of a potential negative human rights impact, the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.4,Impact materiality,,,45.
ESRS 1 - 46,"For positive impacts, materiality is based on: (a) the scale and scope of the impact for actual impacts; and (b) the scale, scope and likelihood of the impact for potential impacts.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.4,Impact materiality,,,46.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Financial materiality,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,3.5,
ESRS 1 - 47,The scope of financial materiality for sustainability reporting is an  expansion of the scope of materiality used in the process of determining  which information should be included in the undertaking’s financial  statements.,paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,,47.
ESRS 1 - 48,"The financial materiality assessment corresponds to the  identification of information that is considered material for primary  users of general-purpose financial reports in making decisions relating  to providing resources to the entity. In particular, information is  considered material for primary users of general-purpose financial  reports if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could  reasonably be expected to influence decisions that they make on the  basis of the undertaking’s sustainability statement .",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,,48.
ESRS 1 - 49,"A sustainability matter is material from a  financial perspective if it triggers or could reasonably be expected to  trigger material financial effects on the undertaking. This is the case when a sustainability matter generates risks or opportunities that have a material influence, or  could reasonably be expected to have a material influence, on the  undertaking’s development, financial position, financial performance,  cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short-,  medium- or long-term. Risks and opportunities may derive from past  events or future events. The financial materiality of a sustainability matter is not  constrained to matters that are within the control of the undertaking  but includes information on material risks and opportunities attributable to business relationships beyond the scope of consolidation used in the preparation of financial statements.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,,49.
ESRS 1 - 50,"Dependencies on natural, human and social resources can be sources of financial risks or opportunities . Dependencies may trigger effects in two possible ways: (a) they may  influence the undertaking’s ability to continue to use or obtain the  resources needed in its business processes, as well as the quality and  pricing of those resources; and (b) they may affect the undertaking’s ability to rely on relationships needed in its business processes on acceptable terms.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,,50.
ESRS 1 - 51,The materiality of risks and opportunities is assessed based on a combination of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential magnitude of the financial effects .,paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.5,Financial materiality,,,51.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Material impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.6,Material impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters,,3.6,
ESRS 1 - 52,"The undertaking’s materiality assessment may lead to the identification of situations in which its actions to address certain impacts or risks , or to benefit from certain opportunities in relation to a sustainability  matter, might have material negative impacts or cause material risks in  relation to one or more other sustainability matters . For example: (a) an action plan  to decarbonise production that involves abandoning certain products  might have material negative impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce and result in material risks due to redundancy payments; or (b) an action plan of an automotive supplier to focus on the supply of  e-vehicles might lead to stranded assets for the production of supply  parts for conventional vehicles.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.6,Material impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters,,,52.
ESRS 1 - 53,"In such situations, the undertaking shall: (a) disclose the existence of material negative impacts or material risks together with the actions that generate them, with a cross-reference to the topic to which the impacts or risks relate; and (b) provide a description of how the material negative impacts or material risks are addressed under the topic to which they relate.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.6,Material impacts or risks arising from actions to address sustainability matters,,,53.
ESRS 1(3.)(3),Level of disaggregation,title_subsection,ESRS 1,3.,3.7,Level of disaggregation,,3.7,
ESRS 1 - 54,"When needed for a proper understanding of its material impacts, risks and opportunities , the undertaking shall disaggregate the reported information: (a) by country,  when there are significant variations of material impacts, risks and  opportunities across countries and when presenting the information at a  higher level of aggregation would obscure material information about  impacts, risks or opportunities; or (b) by significant site or by significant asset, when material impacts, risks and opportunities are highly dependent on a specific location or asset.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.7,Level of disaggregation,,,54.
ESRS 1 - 55,"When defining the appropriate level of  disaggregation for reporting, the undertaking shall consider the  disaggregation adopted in its materiality assessment. Depending on the  undertaking’s specific facts and circumstances, a disaggregation by  subsidiary may be necessary.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.7,Level of disaggregation,,,55.
ESRS 1 - 56,"Where data from different levels, or  multiple locations within a level, is aggregated, the undertaking shall  ensure that this aggregation does not obscure the specificity and  context necessary to interpret the information. The undertaking shall  not aggregate material items that differ in nature.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.7,Level of disaggregation,,,56.
ESRS 1 - 57,"When the undertaking presents information  disaggregated by sectors, it shall adopt the ESRS sector classification  to be specified in a delegated act adopted by the Commission pursuant to  article 29b(1) third subparagraph, point (ii), of  Directive 2013/34/EU. When a topical or sector-specific ESRS  requires that a specific level of disaggregation is adopted in preparing  a specific item of information, the requirement in the topical or  sector-specific ESRS shall prevail.",paragraph,ESRS 1,3.,3.7,Level of disaggregation,,,57.
ESRS 1(4.),Due diligence,title_section,ESRS 1,4.,,,,4.,
ESRS 1 - 58,"The outcome of the undertaking’s  sustainability due diligence process (referred to as “due diligence” in  the international instruments mentioned below) informs the undertaking’s  assessment of its material impacts, risks and opportunities . ESRS do not impose any conduct  requirements in relation to due diligence; nor do they extend or modify  the role of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of the  undertaking with regard to the conduct of due diligence.",paragraph,ESRS 1,4.,,,,,58.
ESRS 1 - 59,"Due diligence is the process by which  undertakings identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they  address the actual and potential negative impacts on the environment and people  connected with their business. These include negative impacts connected  with the undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream  value chain, including through its products or services, as well as  through its business relationships. Due diligence is an on-going  practice that responds to and may trigger changes in the undertaking’s  strategy, business model, activities, business relationships, operating,  sourcing and selling contexts. This process is described in the  international instruments of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.",paragraph,ESRS 1,4.,,,,,59.
ESRS 1 - 60,"These international instruments identify a  number of steps in the due diligence process, including the  identification and assessment of negative impacts connected with the  undertaking’s own operations and its upstream and downstream value  chain, including through its products or services, as well as through  its business relationships. Where the undertaking cannot address all  impacts at once, the due diligence process allows for action to be  prioritised based on the severity and likelihood of the impacts. It is  this aspect of the due diligence process that informs the assessment of  material impacts (see section 3.4 of this Standard). The identification  of material impacts also supports the identification of material  sustainability risks and opportunities , which are often a product of such impacts.",paragraph,ESRS 1,4.,,,,,60.
ESRS 1 - 61,"The core elements of due diligence are  reflected directly in Disclosure Requirements set out in ESRS 2 and in  the topical ESRS, as illustrated below: (a) embedding due diligence in governance, strategy and business model ( 3 ) .

For example, the  undertaking might be exposed to several impacts or risks, each of which  could cause the same type of disruption, such as disruptions to the  undertaking’s supply chain . Information about an individual  source of risk might not be material if disruption from that source is  highly unlikely to occur.

ESRS 1 - 100,"When it is impracticable to determine the  effect of an error on all prior periods presented, the undertaking shall  restate the comparative information to correct the error from the  earliest date practicable. When correcting disclosures for a prior  period, the undertaking shall not use hindsight either in making  assumptions about what the management’s intentions would have been in a  prior period or in estimating the amounts disclosed in a prior period.  This requirement applies to correction of both backward-looking and  forward- looking disclosures.",paragraph,ESRS 1,7.,7.5,Reporting errors in prior periods,,,100.

The amount of precision needed and attainable, and the  factors that make information accurate, depend on the nature of the  information and the nature of the matters it addresses.

IRO-1 in section 4.1 of ESRS 2 includes general disclosure  requirements (DR) about the undertaking’s process to identify impacts,  risks and opportunities and assess their materiality. SBM-3 of ESRS 2  provides general disclosures requirements on the material impact, risks  and opportunities resulting from the undertaking’s materiality  assessment. The undertaking can omit all disclosure requirements in a  topical standard if it assessed that the topic in question is not  material. In that case it may disclose a brief explanation of the  conclusions of the materiality assessment for that topic but shall disclose a detailed explanation in the case of ESRS E1 climate change  (IRO-2 ESRS 2). ESRS set disclosure requirements, not behavioral  requirements. Disclosure requirements in relation to action plans , targets , policies , scenario analysis and transition plans are proportionate because they are  contingent on the undertaking having these, which may depend on the  size, capacity, resources, and skills of the undertaking.

At  the species level, data layers on the ranges of different species can  be used to predict the species that may be present at different  locations. This includes operation sites and  sourcing locations. Different range layers will have different levels of  accuracy depending on certain factors (e.g., whether species ranges  have been refined based on availability of habitat ).  Information on the threat status of the species, and the activities that  threaten them, can provide an indication of the likely contribution  that business activities may be having on driving population trends and  threat status. ii. At  the ecosystem level, data layers reflecting change in the extent and  condition of ecosystems can be applied, including levels of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. (c) modelled  biodiversity state data: Model-based approaches are commonly used for  measuring ecosystem level indicators (e.g., extent, condition, or  function). Models quantify how the magnitude of different pressures  affects the state of biodiversity. These are referred to as  pressure-state relationships and are based on globally collected data.  Modelling results are applied locally to estimate how undertaking-level  pressures will cause changes in ecosystem condition.An impact driver  generally has three main characteristics: magnitude (e.g., amount of  contaminant, noise intensity), spatial extent (e.g., area of land  contaminated) and temporal extent (duration of persistence of  contaminant).",paragraph,ESRS E4,,,"Disclosure Requirement E4-6 –

For example, negative impacts on  value chain workers may disrupt the undertaking’s operations (through  customers refusing to buy its products or state agencies impounding its  goods) and harm its reputation. Conversely, respect for workers’ rights  and active support programmes (for example through financial literacy  initiatives) can bring business opportunities, such as more reliable  supply or widening of the future consumer base.",paragraph,ESRS S2,,,Objective,,,3.

Another example is where selling goods premised on cheapest prices for customers create operational risks as suppliers under extreme price pressure  may sub-contract production, leading to lower quality, and a longer,  less transparent, and less controllable supply chain. Reputational and  business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of low-skilled,  low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for  them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.",paragraph,ESRS S2,,,"Disclosure Requirement S2-5 –

Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s  dependency on value chain workers include a shortage in skilled workers  or political decisions or legislation affecting value chain workers  working for logistics providers.
