1,What is the required methodology for calculating carbon offsets?,"The required methodology for calculating carbon offsets, as outlined in the document, includes the following key principles:
	1.	Recognized Quality Standards: Carbon credits must meet recognized quality standards to ensure their validity .
	2.	Disaggregation of Carbon Credits: The disclosure should specify:
	•	The share of reduction projects vs. removal projects.
	•	Whether removal projects are biogenic or technological.
	•	The percentage of carbon credits from each recognized quality standard.
	•	The share of carbon credits from projects within the EU.
	•	The share qualifying as a corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement .
	3.	Avoiding Double Counting:
	•	Carbon credits from GHG emission reduction projects within an entity’s value chain should not be included, as those reductions are already accounted for in Scope 2 or Scope 3 emissions.
	•	Similarly, carbon credits from GHG removal projects within the value chain should not be counted separately .
	4.	Not to Offset GHG Emissions or Reduction Targets:
	•	Carbon credits should not be reported as an offset for an entity’s disclosed GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2, or 3).
	•	Carbon credits should not be used as a means to meet GHG emission reduction targets .
	5.	Calculation of Future Cancellations:
	•	The amount of carbon credits to be canceled in the future must be calculated as the sum of credits in metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent over the duration of existing contractual agreements .
	6.	Internal Carbon Pricing Disclosure:
	•	If an organization uses internal carbon pricing, it must explain how the pricing aligns with financial reporting and decision-making processes .

This methodology ensures transparency, prevents double counting, and aligns with international climate agreements."
2,"If a company has set a Net-Zero target, what disclosures are mandatory?","If a company has set a Net-Zero target, the following disclosures are mandatory:

	•	The company must explain how its residual GHG emissions (after approximately 90-95% reduction) will be neutralized.
	•	This should align with a recognized sectoral decarbonization pathway .
	2.	Disclosure of GHG Removals and Storage
	•	The company must report GHG removals and storage from its own operations and value chain.
	•	Disaggregation by removal activity (e.g., biogenic, technological) is required.
	•	Calculation assumptions, methodologies, and frameworks must be disclosed .
	3.	Disclosure of Carbon Credits Used or Planned
	•	If carbon credits are used to support net-zero claims, the company must report:
	•	The total amount of carbon credits in metric tonnes of CO2eq.
	•	Verification against recognized quality standards.
	•	Future planned cancellations and contractual agreements .
	4.	Public Claims on GHG Neutrality
	•	If the company makes public claims of GHG neutrality using carbon credits, it must disclose:
	•	Whether these claims are accompanied by GHG emission reduction targets.
	•	How reliance on carbon credits does not impede actual GHG reductions.
	•	The credibility and integrity of the carbon credits used .
	5.	Internal Carbon Pricing Disclosure (if applicable)
	•	If the company applies internal carbon pricing, it must explain how it supports decision-making.
	•	This includes details about the pricing scheme, scope, and methodology .

These disclosures ensure transparency and accountability in achieving Net-Zero targets."
