The  independent  operation  of  the  transferred  business must be determined primarily from a functional and only secondarily  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  The  assets transferred must be capable of operating as an independent  undertaking  without  requiring  additional  investment. The fact that a company receiving a transfer takes out a bank loan under normal market conditions cannot in itself mean that the transferred business is not independent, even if the loan is guaranteed by its shareholders. However,  if  the  financial  situation  of  the  receiving company as a whole would inevitably point to the conclusion that it would not be able to survive by its own means, the transferred business might not be regarded as independent. Such assessment as to whether or not a business is independent must be left to the national court, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case see Andersen og Jensen (Case C-43/00). As emphasized by the ECJ, the Directive does not grant EU Member States the discretion to introduce conditions beyond the ones outlined in the directive itself.

2025-06-23 12:31:01,Is it mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, certain branches that are opened in a Member State by undertakings not governed by the law of a Member State are required to publish and make accessible a report on income tax information.

2025-06-23 12:31:24,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The information provided does not specify how negative income tax accrued should be reported.

The  independent  operation  of  the  transferred  business must be determined primarily from a functional and only secondarily  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  The  assets transferred must be capable of operating as an independent  undertaking  without  requiring  additional  investment. The fact that a company receiving a transfer takes out a bank loan under normal market conditions cannot in itself mean that the transferred business is not independent, even if the loan is guaranteed by its shareholders. However,  if  the  financial  situation  of  the  receiving company as a whole would inevitably point to the conclusion that it would not be able to survive by its own means, the transferred business might not be regarded as independent. Such assessment as to whether or not a business is independent must be left to the national court, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case see Andersen og Jensen (Case C-43/00). As emphasized by the ECJ, the Directive does not grant EU Member States the discretion to introduce conditions beyond the ones outlined in the directive itself.

2025-06-23 14:59:02,Is it mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, it is mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings under certain conditions.

2025-06-23 14:59:19,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The sources provided do not mention specific instructions or regulations for reporting negative income tax accrued in the context of EU tax reporting regulations.

Where these costs are fixed as a flat rate, the fixed amount may not exceed 5% of the profits distributed by the subsidiary. France, Germany,  Italy,  Slovenia  and  Spain  have  fixed  these (management) costs at 5% of the dividends received. As a consequence, these countries in fact only exempt 95% of the dividends received. The Member State of the parent company may also refuse the deduction of a subsidiary's losses (from the taxable profits of the parent company) resulting from the distribution of the subsidiary's profits. These possibilities may be exercised only in accordance with the EU fundamental freedoms and within the limits of  the  Directive.  In  particular,  Member  States  may  not generally  deny  the  deductibility  of  costs  related  to  a holding in another Member State until the profits from the shareholding are taxable -see Bosal (Case  C168/01).  Likewise,  Member  States  may  not  deny  the deductibility  of  the  interest  paid  by  a  parent  company when such interest does not relate to the financing of the holding  see Argenta  Spaarbank  NV (Case  C-39/16).

2025-06-23 14:59:51,Do I need to disclose information for my US-based subsidiary?,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, according to Article 48b(4) of Directive 2013/34/EU, certain medium-sized and large subsidiary undertakings that are controlled by an ultimate parent undertaking not governed by the law of a Member State are required to publish and make accessible a report on income tax information concerning that ultimate parent undertaking.

The TCA does cover some aspects of taxation, particularly those related to tax transparency. However, it's important to note that the TCA does not govern direct taxation, which is generally regulated by national laws. Therefore, while the UK must respect certain principles in its tax policy, it is not subject to EU tax rules in the same way as EU Member States.

In addition, the UK legislation has ended the application of retained EU laws, which means that general principles of EU law no longer form part of UK law.

Therefore, if you work in the UK, your taxation is primarily subject to UK tax rules rather than EU tax rules.

This Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation  (BEFIT)  proposal  replaced  the  Commission's Common Corporate Tax Base and Common Consolidated Corporate  Tax  Base  proposals,  which  were  withdrawn ( see previous versions of the chapter). The BEFIT proposal aims to implement a common corporate tax framework for EU large-scale groups of companies, which would replace the 27 national systems. The proposal establishes a common set of rules to determine the tax base of companies that are part of a group that prepares consolidated financial statements and are subject to corporate income tax in a Member State.

2025-06-23 15:02:12,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The sources provided do not mention specific instructions or regulations for reporting negative income tax accrued in the context of EU tax reporting regulations.

2025-06-23 20:57:46,hello,{'label': '1.4. Decision-making with regard to tax policy'},"Currently,  taxation  is  the  only  policy  area  where  decision-making requires unanimity among Member States. There is,  however, an 'escape clause' from unanimity, the so-called 'enhanced cooperation' mechanism, which is very rarely used. This mechanism can be enacted where the Council fails to secure the necessary level of agreement, but a group of nine or more Member States indicate that  they  still  want  to  undertake  action  in  the  relevant area. The Commission can then withdraw its initial proposal  and  provide  a  new  one  that  would  only  apply between Member States who want to be bound by the new rules.  Enhanced  cooperation  will  generally  only  come into play when the discussions have halted, but significant  agreement  exists  between  a  substantial  number  of Member States on the type of rules that they would like to see introduced. Ongoing examples of difficulty in achieving unanimity in tax policies, e.g. the attempt to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB, see section 3.8.) or a digital services tax ( see section 5.1.), have pushed the Commission  to  look  for  alternative  decision-making mechanisms. As such, the Commission has proposed a gradual shift to qualified majority voting (QMV) that would remove the need  for  unanimity  (COM(2019)  8  final  of  15  January 2019). In this regard, the Commission invited the European Council to adopt by unanimity a decision authorizing  the  European  Council  for  Financial  and  Economic affairs (ECOFIN) to act by a qualified majority in a specific area (based on article 48(7) of the TEU). In particular, the Commission has suggested that QMV could  be  initially  introduced  for  measures  designed  to improve  cooperation  and  mutual  assistance  between Member States in fighting tax fraud and evasion, as well as for administrative initiatives which would benefit EU businesses  (e.g.  harmonized  reporting  obligations)  and those in which taxation supports other policy goals (e.g. fighting  climate  change,  protecting  the  environment  or improving  public  health).  The  Council  could  subsequently  consider  extending  the  QMV  (from  2025)  to measures designed to modernize already harmonized EU rules  (e.g.  VAT  and  excise  duty  rules),  or  to  major  tax projects such as the above-mentioned CCCTB and a new system for the taxation of the digital economy. On 4 May 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution proposing the abolition of unanimity in the Council (2022/2705(RSP)). According to the programme of the Spanish Presidency of  the  Council  for  the  second  semester  of  2023,  the Spanish presidency had planned to advance the debate on passerelle clauses to extend the use of qualified majority voting on essential EU policies, such as taxation. However, no relevant progress was achieved on this point. In this regard, the European Parliament reiterated its call to amend  the  EU  treaties  in  a  resolution  adopted  on  22 November  2023,  by  which  it  sent  a  proposal  to  the Council  and  the  Commission,  as  well  as  to  the  parliaments and governments of the Member States (2022/2051(INL)).","Hello, I'm here to assist you with EU tax reporting regulations.

2025-06-24 13:19:10,hello,{'label': '1.4. Decision-making with regard to tax policy'},"Currently,  taxation  is  the  only  policy  area  where  decision-making requires unanimity among Member States. There is,  however, an 'escape clause' from unanimity, the so-called 'enhanced cooperation' mechanism, which is very rarely used. This mechanism can be enacted where the Council fails to secure the necessary level of agreement, but a group of nine or more Member States indicate that  they  still  want  to  undertake  action  in  the  relevant area. The Commission can then withdraw its initial proposal  and  provide  a  new  one  that  would  only  apply between Member States who want to be bound by the new rules.  Enhanced  cooperation  will  generally  only  come into play when the discussions have halted, but significant  agreement  exists  between  a  substantial  number  of Member States on the type of rules that they would like to see introduced. Ongoing examples of difficulty in achieving unanimity in tax policies, e.g. the attempt to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB, see section 3.8.) or a digital services tax ( see section 5.1.), have pushed the Commission  to  look  for  alternative  decision-making mechanisms. As such, the Commission has proposed a gradual shift to qualified majority voting (QMV) that would remove the need  for  unanimity  (COM(2019)  8  final  of  15  January 2019). In this regard, the Commission invited the European Council to adopt by unanimity a decision authorizing  the  European  Council  for  Financial  and  Economic affairs (ECOFIN) to act by a qualified majority in a specific area (based on article 48(7) of the TEU). In particular, the Commission has suggested that QMV could  be  initially  introduced  for  measures  designed  to improve  cooperation  and  mutual  assistance  between Member States in fighting tax fraud and evasion, as well as for administrative initiatives which would benefit EU businesses  (e.g.  harmonized  reporting  obligations)  and those in which taxation supports other policy goals (e.g. fighting  climate  change,  protecting  the  environment  or improving  public  health).  The  Council  could  subsequently  consider  extending  the  QMV  (from  2025)  to measures designed to modernize already harmonized EU rules  (e.g.  VAT  and  excise  duty  rules),  or  to  major  tax projects such as the above-mentioned CCCTB and a new system for the taxation of the digital economy. On 4 May 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution proposing the abolition of unanimity in the Council (2022/2705(RSP)). According to the programme of the Spanish Presidency of  the  Council  for  the  second  semester  of  2023,  the Spanish presidency had planned to advance the debate on passerelle clauses to extend the use of qualified majority voting on essential EU policies, such as taxation. However, no relevant progress was achieved on this point. In this regard, the European Parliament reiterated its call to amend  the  EU  treaties  in  a  resolution  adopted  on  22 November  2023,  by  which  it  sent  a  proposal  to  the Council  and  the  Commission,  as  well  as  to  the  parliaments and governments of the Member States (2022/2051(INL)).",Hello!

The 2024 European Tax Handbook covers surveys on 49 countries and jurisdictions. All information on the European tax systems has been updated to reflect, as much as possible, the laws applicable in 2024. As before, the European Tax Handbook includes in addition to the country level surveys, a chapter on EU Direct Taxation  (together  with  the  most  important  tax  directives),  as  well  as  descriptions  of  seven  of  the  most important Swiss cantons, i.e. Basel-Stadt, Bern, Geneva, Schwyz, Vaud, Zug and Zurich. All the country chapters of this book are also available in the online collection Country Surveys of the IBFD Tax Research Platform, which contains descriptions of the tax systems  of  53  European  countries  and,  in  addition, descriptions of the tax systems of all 26 Swiss cantons. The online title is European Tax Explorer (Plus) . It also includes the texts of income tax treaties concluded by all European countries. The online collection Country Surveys has quarterly updates; the chapters are revised as new information becomes available. More  comprehensive  coverage  of  the  majority  of  the jurisdictions can be found  in the online collection Country Analyses. A combination of Country Surveys, Country  Analyses  and  the  texts  of  income  tax  treaties concluded  by  countries  worldwide  is  offered  via  the online title Global Tax Explorer Plus and regional subsets of this title on Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe,  Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Countries  in  North  America  can  easily  be  ordered  via  the online title Tax Explorer - Country Select , which enables you to choose the exact countries for which you need coverage on the essentials on international tax.

This Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation  (BEFIT)  proposal  replaced  the  Commission's Common Corporate Tax Base and Common Consolidated Corporate  Tax  Base  proposals,  which  were  withdrawn ( see previous versions of the chapter). The BEFIT proposal aims to implement a common corporate tax framework for EU large-scale groups of companies, which would replace the 27 national systems. The proposal establishes a common set of rules to determine the tax base of companies that are part of a group that prepares consolidated financial statements and are subject to corporate income tax in a Member State. If the proposal is adopted  by  the  Council,  Member  States  will  have  to implement  the  BEFIT  into  their  national  laws  by  1 January 2028 and the new rules will apply from 1 July 2028. Together with the BEFIT proposal, the European Commission proposed a Council directive establishing a Head Office  Tax  system  for  micro,  small  and  medium  sized enterprises, and amending Directive 2011/16/EU (HOT) (COM(2023) 528 final) and a transfer pricing directive the  Council  directive  on  transfer  pricing  (COM(2023) 529 final) - to harmonize minimum standards. For details on the latter, see section 7. On 4 December 2023, MEPs of the ECON Committee discussed the draft report on the BEFIT proposal (2023/0321(CNS)).

2025-06-24 13:23:20,hihihi,{'label': '1.4. Decision-making with regard to tax policy'},"Currently,  taxation  is  the  only  policy  area  where  decision-making requires unanimity among Member States. There is,  however, an 'escape clause' from unanimity, the so-called 'enhanced cooperation' mechanism, which is very rarely used. This mechanism can be enacted where the Council fails to secure the necessary level of agreement, but a group of nine or more Member States indicate that  they  still  want  to  undertake  action  in  the  relevant area. The Commission can then withdraw its initial proposal  and  provide  a  new  one  that  would  only  apply between Member States who want to be bound by the new rules.  Enhanced  cooperation  will  generally  only  come into play when the discussions have halted, but significant  agreement  exists  between  a  substantial  number  of Member States on the type of rules that they would like to see introduced. Ongoing examples of difficulty in achieving unanimity in tax policies, e.g. the attempt to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB, see section 3.8.) or a digital services tax ( see section 5.1.), have pushed the Commission  to  look  for  alternative  decision-making mechanisms. As such, the Commission has proposed a gradual shift to qualified majority voting (QMV) that would remove the need  for  unanimity  (COM(2019)  8  final  of  15  January 2019). In this regard, the Commission invited the European Council to adopt by unanimity a decision authorizing  the  European  Council  for  Financial  and  Economic affairs (ECOFIN) to act by a qualified majority in a specific area (based on article 48(7) of the TEU). In particular, the Commission has suggested that QMV could  be  initially  introduced  for  measures  designed  to improve  cooperation  and  mutual  assistance  between Member States in fighting tax fraud and evasion, as well as for administrative initiatives which would benefit EU businesses  (e.g.  harmonized  reporting  obligations)  and those in which taxation supports other policy goals (e.g. fighting  climate  change,  protecting  the  environment  or improving  public  health).  The  Council  could  subsequently  consider  extending  the  QMV  (from  2025)  to measures designed to modernize already harmonized EU rules  (e.g.  VAT  and  excise  duty  rules),  or  to  major  tax projects such as the above-mentioned CCCTB and a new system for the taxation of the digital economy. On 4 May 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution proposing the abolition of unanimity in the Council (2022/2705(RSP)). According to the programme of the Spanish Presidency of  the  Council  for  the  second  semester  of  2023,  the Spanish presidency had planned to advance the debate on passerelle clauses to extend the use of qualified majority voting on essential EU policies, such as taxation. However, no relevant progress was achieved on this point. In this regard, the European Parliament reiterated its call to amend  the  EU  treaties  in  a  resolution  adopted  on  22 November  2023,  by  which  it  sent  a  proposal  to  the Council  and  the  Commission,  as  well  as  to  the  parliaments and governments of the Member States (2022/2051(INL)).","It seems like you're in a good mood.

The ATAD was amended by Amending Directive to the 2016 Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (2017/952) (ATAD 2) - adopted by the Council on 29 May 2017 - to address hybrid  mismatches  involving  third  countries.  Member States had to implement ATAD 2 by 31 December 2018, which was extended to 31 December 2019 for the implementation  of  the  exit  tax  provisions  and  hybrid  mismatches,  and  to  31  December  2021  for  reverse  hybrid mismatches. On 19 August 2020, the Commission adopted the first report on  the implementation  of  the  ATAD,  which included an overview of the implementation of the interest  limitation,  and  general  anti-abuse  and  CFC  rules across Member States (COM(2020) 383 final). By 1 January 2023, almost all Member States had implemented the ATAD's rules, except for some countries that already  had  similar  provisions  in  place  under  their domestic  law  deemed  equally  effective  as  the  ATAD's rules. The hybrid mismatch rules of ATAD 2 have been implemented by all Member States.","It seems like you're in a good mood.

Member  States  had  to  implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under  the  amending  directive,  Member  States  must refrain from taxing qualifying profit distributions to the extent they are not deductible by the subsidiary. This anti-hybrid rule aims to prevent groups of companies from structuring  their  intra-group  payments,  through  the use  of  hybrid  instruments,  to  realize  mismatches  and double non-taxation outcomes. Such mismatch might occur if the Member State of the borrower qualifies a payment as debt, while the Member State of the parent company qualifies the payment as equity. As a result, the amount paid (qualifying  as  interest)  would  be  deductible  in  the  first Member State and not taxable in the other (qualifying as dividend). The anti-hybrid rule prevents this effect.","It seems like you're in a good mood.

Where these costs are fixed as a flat rate, the fixed amount may not exceed 5% of the profits distributed by the subsidiary. France, Germany,  Italy,  Slovenia  and  Spain  have  fixed  these (management) costs at 5% of the dividends received. As a consequence, these countries in fact only exempt 95% of the dividends received. The Member State of the parent company may also refuse the deduction of a subsidiary's losses (from the taxable profits of the parent company) resulting from the distribution of the subsidiary's profits. These possibilities may be exercised only in accordance with the EU fundamental freedoms and within the limits of  the  Directive.  In  particular,  Member  States  may  not generally  deny  the  deductibility  of  costs  related  to  a holding in another Member State until the profits from the shareholding are taxable -see Bosal (Case  C168/01).  Likewise,  Member  States  may  not  deny  the deductibility  of  the  interest  paid  by  a  parent  company when such interest does not relate to the financing of the holding  see Argenta  Spaarbank  NV (Case  C-39/16). Member States  cannot  impose  the  liability  to  make  an advance payment which exceeds the 5% threshold on a parent entity when redistributing profits received by its subsidiaries to its shareholders (even if such profits have not been subject to corporate income tax at the regular corporate income tax rate) see Schneider Electric and Others (Case C-556/20). In  addition,  under  the  Amending  Protocol  to  the  European  Union-Switzerland  Agreement  (2015),  dividends paid by subsidiaries to parent companies, whereby one is established in the European Union and the other in Switzerland,  are  exempt  if  the  parent  company  maintains  a direct minimum holding of 25% for at least 2 years in the subsidiary (paying) company.","Hello again!

The SE Regulation does not contain provisions concerning groups of companies. An SE is resident in the Member State of its real seat, which is not necessarily the Member State of its statutory seat. For tax purposes, SEs are treated the same as public limited liability companies that are formed under the national laws of a Member State. Losses of an SE's foreign permanent establishment  can  be  offset  against  the  SE's  profits.

To this end,  the  Commission  issued  a  proposal  for  a  Council directive  on  11  May  2022  (COM(2022)  216  final)  and opened a feedback period which ran from 13 May until 8 July 2022. In short, the DEBRA initiative proposes: The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) has recommended to include an exclusion from the rules for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and micro-enterprises on the grounds that the proposed measures could make EU companies financially weaker and hamper investment, growth and job creation in the European Union (ECO/595-EESC-2022).

The beneficial owner is not a formally identified recipient, but rather the entity that economically benefits from, and has the freedom to use and enjoy, the interest and/or royalties. In this regard, the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Commentary on Articles 11 and 12 is relevant for interpreting the term 'beneficial owner' see N Luxembourg 1 (Joined Cases C-115/16, C118/16, C-119/16 and C-299/16). A permanent establishment can be considered the beneficial owner of the interest and/or royalties provided two requirements are met: The Directive  aims  to  eliminate  double  taxation  in  the source Member State at the level of the recipient of the interest  and/or  royalties  and  therefore  only  eliminates legal double taxation. Member States may, accordingly, limit the deductibility of the payment from the debtor's tax  base  see  Scheuten  Solar  Technology (Case  C397/09).

Harmful tax competition and forbidden State aid'},"Tax measures introduced by Member States are subject to State  aid  rules  regulated  under  the  TFEU.  Any  aid granted by a Member State or through State resources that distorts competition and trade within the European Union by  favouring  certain  companies  or  the  production  of certain goods is incompatible with the internal market. Furthermore,  Member  States  must  notify  the  Commission of all new aid measures, and wait for the Commission's  decision  before  they  put  the  measure  into  effect ( see State  Aid  procedures below).  Aid  granted  without the Commission's prior authorization constitutes unlawful State aid. However, in some circumstances, government interventions are necessary for a well-functioning economy. Accordingly, the TFEU, in article 107(2) and (3),  also  leaves  room  for  some  policy  objectives  for which State aid can be given that is considered compatible with the internal market. Examples of such aid include financial compensation for the  damages caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences  or  to  remedy  a  serious  disturbance  in  the economy of a Member State. In this regard, the Commission  adopted  the  State  aid  Temporary  Framework  to enable  Member  States  to  grant  several  types  of  aid, including  (selective)  tax advantages  to  mitigate  the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Member States could decide to take measures, such as implementing wage subsidies and suspending payments of  corporate  and  value  added  taxes  or  social  contributions. The Framework was in place until, at the latest, 31 December  2023.  Similarly,  the  Commission  adopted  a State aid Temporary Crisis Framework to enable Member States to support the economy in the context of Russia's invasion  of  Ukraine  until  31  December  2022  (OJ  C 131I/1  24.03.2022),  which  was  extended  until  30  June 2024. In other instances, State aid plans are moving towards a longer-term  basis.  The  European  Commission  adopted the Temporary  Crisis  and  Transition  Framework  to support measures in key sectors for the transition to a netzero  economy,  in  line  with  the  Green  Deal  Industrial Plan. The new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, in addition to amending and prolonging in part the State aid Temporary Crisis Framework related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine (until 30 June 2024), also introduced other measures to accelerate investments in key sectors for the transition towards a net-zero economy (until 31 December 2025). Another example of State aid which can be considered compatible with the internal market is the framework for research, development and innovation (RDI Framework), which sets out the rules under which Member States can grant  State  aid  to  companies  for  RDI  activities,  while ensuring  a  level  playing  field  (C(2022)  7388  final). Under the RDI Framework, Member States can provide aid for R&D projects, feasibility studies, construction of research facilities and testing and experimentation infrastructures and innovation activities. Member States must notify this type of aid to the Commission. In  addition,  the  Commission  has  issued  many  regulations,  notices,  frameworks,  guidelines and  communications in respect of State aid. State aid rules only apply to measures that meet all of the following criteria: With effect from July 2023, the European Commission is also  able  to  investigate  subsidies  granted  by  non-EU public authorities to companies operating in the European Union ( see Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560)). On  10  July  2023,  the  European  Commission  adopted rules (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1441) clarifying the practical aspects of the implementation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560).","As a student in France and a resident of China, your tax reporting obligations depend on several factors, including the source of your income, the duration of your stay in France, and the tax treaties between France and China.

Article 48c(5), Directive 2013/34/EU","As a student in France and a resident of China, your tax reporting obligations depend on several factors, including the source of your income, the duration of your stay in France, and the tax treaties between France and China.

In general, as a non-EU resident (China), you may be subject to tax in France on income derived from French sources, such as scholarships, grants, or income from a part-time job. However, the tax treatment of your income will depend on the specific tax laws and agreements between France and China.

To determine your tax reporting obligations, can you please specify:

1. What type of income do you have (e.g., scholarship, part-time job, investments)?
2. Do you have a French bank account or receive income from a French source?
3. Have you obtained a French tax identification number (numéro d'identification fiscale)?

Hybrid mismatches'},"The goal of the provisions on  hybrid  mismatches is  to neutralize the effects of arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an entity or instrument under the laws of two or more jurisdictions. Under the ATAD (as amended by ATAD 2), hybrid mismatches concern situations in which an entity or transaction is treated differently - for tax purposes - under the laws of two Member States (or of a third country), and this difference results in: The hybrid mismatches covered by the ATAD are related to  entities,  financial  instruments  and  permanent  establishments.  Specifically,  the  ATAD  covers  hybrid  mismatches  resulting  from  (i)  payments  under  a  financial instrument; (ii) payments to a hybrid entity, permanent establishment or a disregarded permanent establishment; (iii) payments made by a hybrid entity to its owners; (iv) deemed payments between the head office and permanent establishment or between two or more permanent establishments; and (v) payments made by a hybrid entity or a permanent establishment. Additionally, the ATAD includes  specific  rules  for  dealing  with  dual  residence mismatches, hybrid transfers, imported mismatches and reverse hybrid mismatches. The  personal  scope  of  application  of  the  provisions  is restricted  to  payments  between  associated  enterprises, between permanent establishments and their head offices and payments made under structured arrangements. The ATAD establishes primary and secondary rules under which mismatches are neutralized by one Member State. For  example,  when  the  mismatch  results  in  a  double deduction, the Member State of the investor must deny the deduction. Failing this, the deduction must be denied in the Member State of the payor jurisdiction.","As a student in France and a resident of China, your tax reporting obligations depend on several factors, including the source of your income, the duration of your stay in France, and the tax treaties between France and China.

The deferral of payment  can  be  immediately  discontinued  and  the  tax debt can become recoverable under certain circumstances (e.g. transfers to third countries or bankruptcy of the taxpayer). Certain  temporal  transfers  of  assets  are  excluded  from these  provisions  (e.g.  assets  related  to  the  financing  of securities,  collaterals,  capital  requirements  or  liquidity management).

A French tax identification number, also known as a ""numéro d'identification fiscale"" or ""Numéro de SIREN"" is a unique identifier assigned to individuals and companies for tax purposes. It's usually a 13-digit number.

The beneficial owner is not a formally identified recipient, but rather the entity that economically benefits from, and has the freedom to use and enjoy, the interest and/or royalties. In this regard, the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Commentary on Articles 11 and 12 is relevant for interpreting the term 'beneficial owner' see N Luxembourg 1 (Joined Cases C-115/16, C118/16, C-119/16 and C-299/16). A permanent establishment can be considered the beneficial owner of the interest and/or royalties provided two requirements are met: The Directive  aims  to  eliminate  double  taxation  in  the source Member State at the level of the recipient of the interest  and/or  royalties  and  therefore  only  eliminates legal double taxation. Member States may, accordingly, limit the deductibility of the payment from the debtor's tax  base  see  Scheuten  Solar  Technology (Case  C397/09). In relation to Switzerland, under the Amending Protocol to  the  European  Union-Switzerland  Agreement  (2015), Member  States  must  exempt  interest  and  royalty  payments  to  companies  resident  in  Switzerland,  and  vice versa, under essentially the same conditions as those laid down in the Interest and Royalties Directive (2003/49).","As a student in France, receiving money from your parents and having a French bank account, you may be subject to certain tax obligations.

It consists of the treaties establishing the European Union, namely: These  two  treaties,  which  became  effective  in  2009, consist of the EU founding treaties (the Treaty of Paris (1951),  the  Treaty  of  Rome  (1957)  and  the  Maastricht Treaty (1992)), as amended by subsequent treaties (the Single  European  Act  (1986),  the  Treaty  of  Amsterdam (1997),  the  Treaty  of  Nice  (2001)  and  the  Treaty  of Lisbon (2007)). Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the Maastricht  Treaty  was  renamed  the  Treaty  on  the  European Union and the Treaty of Rome was renamed the TFEU. These treaties distribute competences between the European Union and Member States, and lay down the powers of  the  European  institutions  (i.e.  determine  the  legal framework within which the EU institutions may operate). Nationals and legal entities of a Member State can rely on the  directly  applicable  provisions  of  the  TEU  and  the TFEU. As regards taxation, the TFEU is the most relevant as its main  objectives  are  establishing  a  functioning  internal market,  as  well  as  an  economic  and  monetary  union. These objectives cannot be reached if, inter alia, the four fundamental freedoms ( see section 1.3.) are hindered. As such, any national tax measures that violate these principles must be abolished. Also important for tax purposes is article 115 of the TFEU, which authorizes the issuance of directives. Primary law also includes the accession treaties of new Member States and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.","As a student in France, receiving money from your parents and having a French bank account, you may be subject to certain tax obligations.

The following transactions are taxed: the  head  office  no  longer  has  the  right  to  tax  the transferred assets; In the aforementioned cases, the difference between the fair market value of the assets and the tax value is taxed. Besides  immediate  taxation,  Member  States  must  also provide for the possibility to defer the payment to five instalments in the event of transfers to Member States or third countries that belong to the EEA and that concluded an agreement  equivalent  to  the Recovery  Directive (2010/24).

Certain  temporal  transfers  of  assets  are  excluded  from these  provisions  (e.g.  assets  related  to  the  financing  of securities,  collaterals,  capital  requirements  or  liquidity management).

As a non-EU resident (Chinese citizen) working in France, you'll likely be considered a non-resident taxpayer in France.

In France, non-resident taxpayers are subject to tax on their French-sourced income, which includes income from employment, such as an internship. You may need to report your income from the internship to the French tax authorities.

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Tax withholding**: Your employer in France may withhold taxes on your internship income, which will be reported to the French tax authorities.
2. **Tax declaration**: You may need to file a tax declaration in France, depending on the amount of income you earn and the tax withholding applied.
3. **Tax treaty**: France and China have a tax treaty in place, which may affect how your income is taxed in both countries. You may be eligible for relief from double taxation.

To determine your specific tax obligations, I would recommend:

1. Checking with your employer in France to see if they will withhold taxes on your internship income.
2. Consulting with a tax professional or contacting the French tax authorities (e.g., Service des Impôts des Non-Résidents) to confirm your tax obligations and potential tax liabilities.
3. Reviewing the tax treaty between France and China to understand how your income will be taxed in both countries.

Harmful tax competition and forbidden State aid'},"Tax measures introduced by Member States are subject to State  aid  rules  regulated  under  the  TFEU.  Any  aid granted by a Member State or through State resources that distorts competition and trade within the European Union by  favouring  certain  companies  or  the  production  of certain goods is incompatible with the internal market. Furthermore,  Member  States  must  notify  the  Commission of all new aid measures, and wait for the Commission's  decision  before  they  put  the  measure  into  effect ( see State  Aid  procedures below).  Aid  granted  without the Commission's prior authorization constitutes unlawful State aid. However, in some circumstances, government interventions are necessary for a well-functioning economy. Accordingly, the TFEU, in article 107(2) and (3),  also  leaves  room  for  some  policy  objectives  for which State aid can be given that is considered compatible with the internal market. Examples of such aid include financial compensation for the  damages caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences  or  to  remedy  a  serious  disturbance  in  the economy of a Member State. In this regard, the Commission  adopted  the  State  aid  Temporary  Framework  to enable  Member  States  to  grant  several  types  of  aid, including  (selective)  tax advantages  to  mitigate  the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Member States could decide to take measures, such as implementing wage subsidies and suspending payments of  corporate  and  value  added  taxes  or  social  contributions. The Framework was in place until, at the latest, 31 December  2023.  Similarly,  the  Commission  adopted  a State aid Temporary Crisis Framework to enable Member States to support the economy in the context of Russia's invasion  of  Ukraine  until  31  December  2022  (OJ  C 131I/1  24.03.2022),  which  was  extended  until  30  June 2024. In other instances, State aid plans are moving towards a longer-term  basis.  The  European  Commission  adopted the Temporary  Crisis  and  Transition  Framework  to support measures in key sectors for the transition to a netzero  economy,  in  line  with  the  Green  Deal  Industrial Plan. The new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, in addition to amending and prolonging in part the State aid Temporary Crisis Framework related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine (until 30 June 2024), also introduced other measures to accelerate investments in key sectors for the transition towards a net-zero economy (until 31 December 2025). Another example of State aid which can be considered compatible with the internal market is the framework for research, development and innovation (RDI Framework), which sets out the rules under which Member States can grant  State  aid  to  companies  for  RDI  activities,  while ensuring  a  level  playing  field  (C(2022)  7388  final). Under the RDI Framework, Member States can provide aid for R&D projects, feasibility studies, construction of research facilities and testing and experimentation infrastructures and innovation activities. Member States must notify this type of aid to the Commission. In  addition,  the  Commission  has  issued  many  regulations,  notices,  frameworks,  guidelines and  communications in respect of State aid. State aid rules only apply to measures that meet all of the following criteria: With effect from July 2023, the European Commission is also  able  to  investigate  subsidies  granted  by  non-EU public authorities to companies operating in the European Union ( see Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560)). On  10  July  2023,  the  European  Commission  adopted rules (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1441) clarifying the practical aspects of the implementation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560).","The answer is not covered by the sources.
