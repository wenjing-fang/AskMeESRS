The  independent  operation  of  the  transferred  business must be determined primarily from a functional and only secondarily  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  The  assets transferred must be capable of operating as an independent  undertaking  without  requiring  additional  investment. The fact that a company receiving a transfer takes out a bank loan under normal market conditions cannot in itself mean that the transferred business is not independent, even if the loan is guaranteed by its shareholders. However,  if  the  financial  situation  of  the  receiving company as a whole would inevitably point to the conclusion that it would not be able to survive by its own means, the transferred business might not be regarded as independent. Such assessment as to whether or not a business is independent must be left to the national court, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case see Andersen og Jensen (Case C-43/00). As emphasized by the ECJ, the Directive does not grant EU Member States the discretion to introduce conditions beyond the ones outlined in the directive itself.

2025-06-23 12:31:01,Is it mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, certain branches that are opened in a Member State by undertakings not governed by the law of a Member State are required to publish and make accessible a report on income tax information.

2025-06-23 12:31:24,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The information provided does not specify how negative income tax accrued should be reported.

The  independent  operation  of  the  transferred  business must be determined primarily from a functional and only secondarily  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  The  assets transferred must be capable of operating as an independent  undertaking  without  requiring  additional  investment. The fact that a company receiving a transfer takes out a bank loan under normal market conditions cannot in itself mean that the transferred business is not independent, even if the loan is guaranteed by its shareholders. However,  if  the  financial  situation  of  the  receiving company as a whole would inevitably point to the conclusion that it would not be able to survive by its own means, the transferred business might not be regarded as independent. Such assessment as to whether or not a business is independent must be left to the national court, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case see Andersen og Jensen (Case C-43/00). As emphasized by the ECJ, the Directive does not grant EU Member States the discretion to introduce conditions beyond the ones outlined in the directive itself.

2025-06-23 14:59:02,Is it mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, it is mandatory to report the activities of branches that are not subsidiary undertakings under certain conditions.

2025-06-23 14:59:19,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The sources provided do not mention specific instructions or regulations for reporting negative income tax accrued in the context of EU tax reporting regulations.

Where these costs are fixed as a flat rate, the fixed amount may not exceed 5% of the profits distributed by the subsidiary. France, Germany,  Italy,  Slovenia  and  Spain  have  fixed  these (management) costs at 5% of the dividends received. As a consequence, these countries in fact only exempt 95% of the dividends received. The Member State of the parent company may also refuse the deduction of a subsidiary's losses (from the taxable profits of the parent company) resulting from the distribution of the subsidiary's profits. These possibilities may be exercised only in accordance with the EU fundamental freedoms and within the limits of  the  Directive.  In  particular,  Member  States  may  not generally  deny  the  deductibility  of  costs  related  to  a holding in another Member State until the profits from the shareholding are taxable -see Bosal (Case  C168/01).  Likewise,  Member  States  may  not  deny  the deductibility  of  the  interest  paid  by  a  parent  company when such interest does not relate to the financing of the holding  see Argenta  Spaarbank  NV (Case  C-39/16).

2025-06-23 14:59:51,Do I need to disclose information for my US-based subsidiary?,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16). The GAAR does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of tax evasion, tax fraud or abuse.","Yes, according to Article 48b(4) of Directive 2013/34/EU, certain medium-sized and large subsidiary undertakings that are controlled by an ultimate parent undertaking not governed by the law of a Member State are required to publish and make accessible a report on income tax information concerning that ultimate parent undertaking.

The TCA does cover some aspects of taxation, particularly those related to tax transparency. However, it's important to note that the TCA does not govern direct taxation, which is generally regulated by national laws. Therefore, while the UK must respect certain principles in its tax policy, it is not subject to EU tax rules in the same way as EU Member States.

In addition, the UK legislation has ended the application of retained EU laws, which means that general principles of EU law no longer form part of UK law.

Therefore, if you work in the UK, your taxation is primarily subject to UK tax rules rather than EU tax rules.

This Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation  (BEFIT)  proposal  replaced  the  Commission's Common Corporate Tax Base and Common Consolidated Corporate  Tax  Base  proposals,  which  were  withdrawn ( see previous versions of the chapter). The BEFIT proposal aims to implement a common corporate tax framework for EU large-scale groups of companies, which would replace the 27 national systems. The proposal establishes a common set of rules to determine the tax base of companies that are part of a group that prepares consolidated financial statements and are subject to corporate income tax in a Member State.

2025-06-23 15:02:12,How should negative income tax accrued be reported?,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö  and  Valtiovarainministeriö  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive.",The sources provided do not mention specific instructions or regulations for reporting negative income tax accrued in the context of EU tax reporting regulations.
