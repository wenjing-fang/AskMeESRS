Climate-related opportunity Potential positive effects related to climate change for the undertaking.
Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce opportunities
for undertakings. Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the
region, market, and industry where an undertaking operates.

risk from climate change) longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns.
Acute physical risks arise from particular hazards, especially weather-
related events such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves. Chronic physical
risks arise from longer-term changes in the climate, such as temperature
changes, and their effects on rising sea levels, reduced water availability,
biodiversity loss and changes in land and soil productivity.

ESRS 1 paragraph 64 states: ‘Different sustainability matters can be material in relation to different
parts of the undertaking’s upstream and downstream value chain.’
ESRS 2 paragraph 75 states: ‘The undertaking shall disclose any metrics that it uses to evaluate
performance and effectiveness in relation to a material impact, risk or opportunity.’

the case of a smaller undertaking with no such prior experience. The technical
readiness of undertakings to collect value chain information is expected to improve
over time.
− The availability of tools to access and share value-chain information. What
constitutes reasonable effort may be influenced by the availability of efficient and
commonly used tools, including digital tools, to share value chain information
between undertakings. The availability of such tools is likely to be limited in the
first years of applying the ESRS but should improve over time, including as a
result of the voluntary SME sustainability reporting standards currently being
developed by EFRAG (VSME). This means that undertakings are more likely to
29have recourse to the use of estimates in the first years of applying the ESRS than
they will do in later reporting cycles."
