Climate-related opportunity Potential positive effects related to climate change for the undertaking.
Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce opportunities
for undertakings. Climate-related opportunities will vary depending on the
region, market, and industry where an undertaking operates.
Climate-related physical risk (Physical Risks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven (acute) or from
risk from climate change) longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns.
Acute physical risks arise from particular hazards, especially weather-
related events such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves. Chronic physical
risks arise from longer-term changes in the climate, such as temperature
changes, and their effects on rising sea levels, reduced water availability,
biodiversity loss and changes in land and soil productivity.
