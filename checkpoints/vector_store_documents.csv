As regards taxation, the TFEU is the most relevant as its main  objectives  are  establishing  a  functioning  internal market,  as  well  as  an  economic  and  monetary  union. These objectives cannot be reached if, inter alia, the four fundamental freedoms ( see section 1.3.) are hindered. As such, any national tax measures that violate these principles must be abolished. Also important for tax purposes is article 115 of the TFEU, which authorizes the issuance of directives. Primary law also includes the accession treaties of new Member States and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."

Secondary law can be divided into two categories: Regulations are legal instruments of general application and are binding and directly applicable in each Member State. Directives  are  binding  in  respect  of  the  result  to  be achieved, but - unlike regulations - the manner of their implementation and enforcement is a matter left for the national authorities to determine. In accordance with the case law of the ECJ, a directive is directly enforceable within a Member State only if: If these conditions are fulfilled, the provisions of a directive may have a direct effect, and may be invoked before a court, including those provisions which grant rights to companies and individuals, against Member States. Decisions  are  binding  upon  those  to  whom  they  are addressed, and are directly applicable. Recommendations and opinions are not binding."

The  decisions  of  the  ECJ  are  official,  legally  binding interpretations of EU law. The interpretation of EU law by the ECJ plays a major role in the absence of harmonization in the field of direct taxation. In this regard, the interpretation of the four fundamental freedoms (i.e. the free movement of goods, the free movement of persons (including  the  free  movement  of  EU  citizens,  the  free movement of workers and the freedom of establishment), the freedom to provide services and the free movement of capital and payments) and the interpretation of State aid rules, both regulated under the TFEU, have resulted in an extensive body of case law aimed at preventing cases of discrimination against cross-border activities of companies and distortions in the internal market ( see section 4.). Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as those that result from the constitutional traditions common to Member States, are recognized as general principles of EU law."
e49eef40-8a14-40d8-8b80-6aa086efd6a2,{'label': '1.4. Decision-making with regard to tax policy'},"Currently,  taxation  is  the  only  policy  area  where  decision-making requires unanimity among Member States. There is,  however, an 'escape clause' from unanimity, the so-called 'enhanced cooperation' mechanism, which is very rarely used. This mechanism can be enacted where the Council fails to secure the necessary level of agreement, but a group of nine or more Member States indicate that  they  still  want  to  undertake  action  in  the  relevant area. The Commission can then withdraw its initial proposal  and  provide  a  new  one  that  would  only  apply between Member States who want to be bound by the new rules.  Enhanced  cooperation  will  generally  only  come into play when the discussions have halted, but significant  agreement  exists  between  a  substantial  number  of Member States on the type of rules that they would like to see introduced. Ongoing examples of difficulty in achieving unanimity in tax policies, e.g. the attempt to introduce a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB, see section 3.8.) or a digital services tax ( see section 5.1.), have pushed the Commission  to  look  for  alternative  decision-making mechanisms. As such, the Commission has proposed a gradual shift to qualified majority voting (QMV) that would remove the need  for  unanimity  (COM(2019)  8  final  of  15  January 2019). In this regard, the Commission invited the European Council to adopt by unanimity a decision authorizing  the  European  Council  for  Financial  and  Economic affairs (ECOFIN) to act by a qualified majority in a specific area (based on article 48(7) of the TEU). In particular, the Commission has suggested that QMV could  be  initially  introduced  for  measures  designed  to improve  cooperation  and  mutual  assistance  between Member States in fighting tax fraud and evasion, as well as for administrative initiatives which would benefit EU businesses  (e.g.  harmonized  reporting  obligations)  and those in which taxation supports other policy goals (e.g. fighting  climate  change,  protecting  the  environment  or improving  public  health).  The  Council  could  subsequently  consider  extending  the  QMV  (from  2025)  to measures designed to modernize already harmonized EU rules  (e.g.  VAT  and  excise  duty  rules),  or  to  major  tax projects such as the above-mentioned CCCTB and a new system for the taxation of the digital economy. On 4 May 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution proposing the abolition of unanimity in the Council (2022/2705(RSP)). According to the programme of the Spanish Presidency of  the  Council  for  the  second  semester  of  2023,  the Spanish presidency had planned to advance the debate on passerelle clauses to extend the use of qualified majority voting on essential EU policies, such as taxation. However, no relevant progress was achieved on this point. In this regard, the European Parliament reiterated its call to amend  the  EU  treaties  in  a  resolution  adopted  on  22 November  2023,  by  which  it  sent  a  proposal  to  the Council  and  the  Commission,  as  well  as  to  the  parliaments and governments of the Member States (2022/2051(INL))."
c2b9a69c-7add-4b94-ab33-ec75c0004989,{'label': '1.5. Harmful tax competition and forbidden State aid'},"Tax measures introduced by Member States are subject to State  aid  rules  regulated  under  the  TFEU.  Any  aid granted by a Member State or through State resources that distorts competition and trade within the European Union by  favouring  certain  companies  or  the  production  of certain goods is incompatible with the internal market. Furthermore,  Member  States  must  notify  the  Commission of all new aid measures, and wait for the Commission's  decision  before  they  put  the  measure  into  effect ( see State  Aid  procedures below).  Aid  granted  without the Commission's prior authorization constitutes unlawful State aid. However, in some circumstances, government interventions are necessary for a well-functioning economy. Accordingly, the TFEU, in article 107(2) and (3),  also  leaves  room  for  some  policy  objectives  for which State aid can be given that is considered compatible with the internal market. Examples of such aid include financial compensation for the  damages caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences  or  to  remedy  a  serious  disturbance  in  the economy of a Member State. In this regard, the Commission  adopted  the  State  aid  Temporary  Framework  to enable  Member  States  to  grant  several  types  of  aid, including  (selective)  tax advantages  to  mitigate  the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, Member States could decide to take measures, such as implementing wage subsidies and suspending payments of  corporate  and  value  added  taxes  or  social  contributions. The Framework was in place until, at the latest, 31 December  2023.  Similarly,  the  Commission  adopted  a State aid Temporary Crisis Framework to enable Member States to support the economy in the context of Russia's invasion  of  Ukraine  until  31  December  2022  (OJ  C 131I/1  24.03.2022),  which  was  extended  until  30  June 2024. In other instances, State aid plans are moving towards a longer-term  basis.  The  European  Commission  adopted the Temporary  Crisis  and  Transition  Framework  to support measures in key sectors for the transition to a netzero  economy,  in  line  with  the  Green  Deal  Industrial Plan. The new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, in addition to amending and prolonging in part the State aid Temporary Crisis Framework related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine (until 30 June 2024), also introduced other measures to accelerate investments in key sectors for the transition towards a net-zero economy (until 31 December 2025). Another example of State aid which can be considered compatible with the internal market is the framework for research, development and innovation (RDI Framework), which sets out the rules under which Member States can grant  State  aid  to  companies  for  RDI  activities,  while ensuring  a  level  playing  field  (C(2022)  7388  final). Under the RDI Framework, Member States can provide aid for R&D projects, feasibility studies, construction of research facilities and testing and experimentation infrastructures and innovation activities. Member States must notify this type of aid to the Commission. In  addition,  the  Commission  has  issued  many  regulations,  notices,  frameworks,  guidelines and  communications in respect of State aid. State aid rules only apply to measures that meet all of the following criteria: With effect from July 2023, the European Commission is also  able  to  investigate  subsidies  granted  by  non-EU public authorities to companies operating in the European Union ( see Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560)). On  10  July  2023,  the  European  Commission  adopted rules (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1441) clarifying the practical aspects of the implementation of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (2022/2560)."

Tax measures that are open to all undertakings in a Member State are in principle 'general measures', and do therefore not constitute State aid. To qualify as such, general measures must be effectively open to all undertakings on an equal-access basis, and they may not in effect be reduced in scope  through,  for  example,  a  discretionary  power  (that goes beyond the simple management of tax revenue) of the Member State to grant them or via other factors that restrict their  practical  applicability  see  France  v.  Commission (Kimberly Clark Sopalin) (C-241/94). The criterion of 'selectivity' is also met if the relevant measure only applies to part of the Member State's territory, as is the case for regional, local and sectorial measures. In the same way, measures that only favour: may constitute State aid. Nevertheless, Member States may still choose the economic and tax policy they consider most appropriate and spread the tax burden across different industry sectors in a  way  they  feel  is  most  beneficial  (intersectoral  measures). If they apply without distinction to all undertakings and to the production of all goods and services, the following measures are examples of measures that do not constitute State aid:"

In the view of the Commission, small amounts of aid ( de minimis aid)  do  not  affect  competition  and  trade  see Commission Regulation (EU) 1407/2013 of 18 December 2013. The ceiling for aid covered by the de minimis rule  is,  in  general,  EUR  200,000  in  a  3-year period."

The decision to initiate this procedure is then sent to the relevant Member State. This decision contains a summary of the factual and legal bases for the investigation, and includes a preliminary assessment of the measure's compatibility with EU State aid rules. The Member State  concerned  has  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  this decision. At the end of the formal investigation, the Commission adopts a final decision. There is, however, no legal time frame  within  which  the  in-depth  investigation  must  be completed.  The  possible  outcomes  of  the  investigation are: (i) a positive decision (there is no aid or the aid is compatible); (ii) a conditional decision (the aid is in principle compatible, but implementation must fulfil conditions stated in the decision); or (iii) a negative decision (aid is incompatible and cannot be implemented). If  a  negative  decision  is  related  to  aid  that  has  already been paid out, the Member State must recover that aid (with interest) from the beneficiary (unless such recovery would  be  contrary  to  EU  law).  In  this  way,  the  undue advantage granted to a beneficiary is reversed.

Where these costs are fixed as a flat rate, the fixed amount may not exceed 5% of the profits distributed by the subsidiary. France, Germany,  Italy,  Slovenia  and  Spain  have  fixed  these (management) costs at 5% of the dividends received.

The Member State of the parent company may also refuse the deduction of a subsidiary's losses (from the taxable profits of the parent company) resulting from the distribution of the subsidiary's profits.

Member  States  had  to  implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under  the  amending  directive,  Member  States  must refrain from taxing qualifying profit distributions to the extent they are not deductible by the subsidiary. This anti-hybrid rule aims to prevent groups of companies from structuring  their  intra-group  payments,  through  the use  of  hybrid  instruments,  to  realize  mismatches  and double non-taxation outcomes. Such mismatch might occur if the Member State of the borrower qualifies a payment as debt, while the Member State of the parent company qualifies the payment as equity. As a result, the amount paid (qualifying  as  interest)  would  be  deductible  in  the  first Member State and not taxable in the other (qualifying as dividend). The anti-hybrid rule prevents this effect."
50c43dc2-0b44-4a4b-820a-20bb48752bd5,{'label': 'Directive 2015/121'},"On 27 January 2015, the Council adopted the Amending Directive to the 2011 Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2015/121), which introduced a general anti-abuse provision (GAAR) into the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Member States had to implement this directive by 31 December 2015 at the latest. Under the GAAR, Member States shall not grant the benefits  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  (2011/96)  to  an arrangement (or series of arrangements) which (i) has been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive (the subjective test or the main purpose test); and (ii) is not genuine, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (the objective test). The subjective test is not met if the tax advantage of the structure  is  not  derived  from  the  Directive  (e.g.  avoidance of withholding tax on dividends) or no tax advantage is gained at all. The wording of the main purpose test is largely consistent with the principal purpose test set out in Action 6 of the BEPS Action Plan, which denies treaty benefits if the structure that is set up has tax avoidance as one of its main purposes. An arrangement (or series thereof) is 'not genuine' to the extent that it is not put into place for valid commercial reasons  which  reflect  economic  reality.  In  order  to  be treated as genuine, the company invoking the Directive should have sufficient substance (e.g. it conducts a material business enterprise). Application of the GAAR requires an individual examination of  the  whole  operation  at  issue.  The  competent authorities  may  not,  therefore,  confine  themselves  to applying predetermined general criteria. The imposition of  a  general  tax  measure  that  automatically  excludes certain categories of taxable persons from the tax advantage  without  the  tax  authorities  having  to  provide  evidence of fraud and abuse, would go further than what is necessary for preventing fraud and abuse. For example, the mere fact that a company residing in a Member State is  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  residents  of  third states does not, in itself, indicate the existence of abuse see  Deister and Juhler (Joined  Cases  C-504/16  and  C613/16) and Eqiom and Enka (Case C-6/16). Nevertheless, the tax authorities may consider some situations as indications of abuse. For example, abuse may be present if dividends received are passed on wholly or partially shortly after they are received (even where no legal obligation to pass on such dividends exists), the recipient lacks substance, or the recipient is interposed to obtain the benefits of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive (2011/96). Accordingly,  domestic  safe  harbours  (e.g.  a  minimum level of substance in order for a structure not to qualify as abuse) may not hold see T-Danmark (Cases C-116/16 and C-117/16). Member States must deny treaty benefits if an arrangement  constitutes  abuse  of  rights,  even  if  the  Member State  has  not  implemented  any  specific  anti-avoidance legislation  in  its  domestic  law.  This  requirement  flows from  the  general  EU  anti-abuse  principle  see  ZDenmark v. Skatteministeriet (C-299/16) and T-Danmark (C-116/16 and C-117/16).

In this regard, the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Commentary on Articles 11 and 12 is relevant for interpreting the term 'beneficial owner' see N Luxembourg 1 (Joined Cases C-115/16, C118/16, C-119/16 and C-299/16). A permanent establishment can be considered the beneficial owner of the interest and/or royalties provided two requirements are met: The Directive  aims  to  eliminate  double  taxation  in  the source Member State at the level of the recipient of the interest  and/or  royalties  and  therefore  only  eliminates legal double taxation.

The Directive provides for the deferral of the taxation on unrealized capital gains on certain cross-border reorganizations.  Such  transactions  should  not  cause  immediate direct  tax  consequences  (i.e.  corporation  taxes,  income taxes and capital gains taxes) to the participating companies and their shareholders. The related taxation is deferred up to the moment in which such assets are retransferred. The objective of Merger Directive (90/434) is to facilitate cross-border mergers, divisions and similar transactions between companies established  in  Member  States.  The implementation  of  Merger  Directive  (90/434)  enables groups of companies to reorganize their activities into the most appropriate structure for operating within the European Union without incurring the tax costs which would otherwise generally apply to such transactions."

The  independent  operation  of  the  transferred  business must be determined primarily from a functional and only secondarily  from  a  financial  point  of  view.  The  assets transferred must be capable of operating as an independent  undertaking  without  requiring  additional  investment. The fact that a company receiving a transfer takes out a bank loan under normal market conditions cannot in itself mean that the transferred business is not independent, even if the loan is guaranteed by its shareholders. However,  if  the  financial  situation  of  the  receiving company as a whole would inevitably point to the conclusion that it would not be able to survive by its own means, the transferred business might not be regarded as independent. Such assessment as to whether or not a business is independent must be left to the national court, having regard to the particular circumstances of each case see Andersen og Jensen (Case C-43/00). As emphasized by the ECJ, the Directive does not grant EU Member States the discretion to introduce conditions beyond the ones outlined in the directive itself. Accordingly,  the  Merger  Directive  precludes  legislation  of  an EU Member State that makes the benefit of tax neutrality in case of a partial division subject to conditions (in the case at hand, e.g. reductions in the shareholding or share capital)  that  are  not  specified  in  the  Directive  ( see  GE Infrastructure Hungary Holding (Case C-318/22))."
2b136a28-8b64-43dc-ab1a-3ecc25129744,"{'label': ""Definition of 'company of a Member State'""}","For the purposes of the Directive, 'company of a Member State'  means  a  company  meeting  the  following  three requirements: The Directive also applies to SEs ( see section 2.1.), cooperatives,  mutual  companies,  certain  non-capital-based companies, savings banks, funds and associations engaged in a business."
74e5d38f-ed58-44a6-9c33-956e54404520,{'label': 'Tax treatment'},"The Directive provides that capital gains (i.e. the differences between the 'real values' of the assets and liabilities transferred and their values for tax purposes) arising in  relation  to  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  a merger, division or transfer of assets are not subject to tax. The term 'value for tax purposes' is defined as the value on the basis of which any gain or loss would have been  computed  for  tax  purposes  in  the  transferring company  if  the  assets  or  liabilities  had  been  independently sold at the time of the transaction. Taxation is deferred up to the moment when a subsequent transfer of the assets takes place. The scope of the reliefs available under the Directive is, however, limited to assets and liabilities of the transferring company which become effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company and play a part in generating the profits or losses taken into account for tax  purposes  of  that  receiving  company.  As  such,  the existing book values of the transferred assets and liabilities are maintained by the permanent establishment of the receiving company in the Member State of the transferring company. A future realization of a capital gain upon the alienation of assets and/or liabilities for which in the past  tax  deferral  was  granted,  will  constitute  taxable income of the permanent establishment in the Member State that granted the tax deferral. The purpose of these restrictions  is  to  ensure  that  the  Member  State  of  the transferring  company  retains  the  assets  and  liabilities within its taxing jurisdiction even though no tax has been charged on the transfer to the receiving company. In this way, the financial interests of the Member State of the transferring company are safeguarded. A  further  prerequisite  for  the  tax  deferral  is  that  the receiving  company  continues  the  depreciation  method and computation method for any gains and/or losses with respect to the assets and liabilities transferred, as used by the transferring company. Consequently, if under the tax laws of a Member State the receiving company may opt for a step-up in basis, relief does not apply to the assets and liabilities for which such option is exercised. The  Directive  also  addresses  the  situation  where  the transferring company in a merger, division or transfer of assets has provisions or reserves on its balance sheet that are partly or wholly exempt from tax. Without a specific relief, a merger, division or transfer of assets would often create a tax charge in respect of tax-exempt reserves and provisions  present  in  the  transferring  company.  The Directive  therefore  imposes  a  requirement  on  Member States  to  provide  relief  from  such  taxation.  The  relief takes the form of a deferral of taxation rather than a permanent relief in that the provisions or reserves may only be carried over with the same tax exemption by a permanent establishment of the receiving company situated in the  Member  State  of  the  transferring  company.  The receiving company is furthermore required to assume the rights and  obligations of the transferring company. Accordingly, the Member  State of the transferring company will have a future opportunity to tax the receiving company in respect of the reserves or provisions if and when they are released. If the domestic tax laws of a Member State provide - in pure domestic mergers, divisions and asset transfers - for the  possibility  of  carrying  over  the  tax  losses  not  yet exhausted from the transferring company to the receiving company,  such  carry-over  of  losses  should  also  be extended to the equivalent transactions under the Directive. Consequently, in that instance, the Member State of the transferor company would have to permit the permanent  establishment  of  the  transferee  company  to  carry forward prior losses of that same business. However,  Member  States  may  restrict  the  transfer  of losses  if  the  disappearing  company  is  a  resident  of another  Member  State  while  allowing  the  transfer  of losses between domestic companies, to the extent that the losses are not 'final'. In this sense, Member States must give the domestic receiving company the possibility to show that the disappeared, transferring company of the other Member State has exhausted all possibilities to use these  losses  itself,  and  that  no  other  company  can  use these losses in the future see Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkÃ¶  and  ValtiovarainministeriÃ¶  v.  Oy  A (C123/11).  As  such,  the  receiving  company  should  be allowed to deduct the losses of the transferring company only if it can demonstrate that it is impossible to use the losses  in  the  disappearing  company's  jurisdiction  in future years. In this respect, it is not sufficient - nor deci- sive  -  that  such  losses  cannot  be  transferred  upon  a merger, as there can be other ways that these losses may be offset against future profits in the transferring jurisdiction (e.g. through a sale of the transferring entity to a third party)  see  Memira  Holding  AB  v.  Skatteverket (C607/17). The Directive provides for relief from the taxation that would otherwise arise to the shareholders of the transferor company on the exchange of shares arising in connection with a merger, division or an exchange of shares. However, the relief is provided by means of a 'rollover' so  that  the  taxation  of  such  gains  is  deferred  until  the shares acquired are disposed of. A cash payment, however, may be taxed in the hands of the shareholders even if the payment does not exceed the 10% maximum, provided the shareholder attributes to the securities received a higher value for tax purposes than the  value  the  securities  exchanged  had  immediately before the merger, division or exchange of shares. Gains earned by the transferee company upon the cancellation of a substantial participation, held by the transferee company in the capital of the transferor company prior to the reorganization, are not taxed under the provisions of the Directive. If  the  Commission's BEFIT proposal ( see section  3.8.) was to be adopted, the tax treatment of the Merger Directive would also be applicable. In case of a reorganization in the context of the Merger Directive, the BEFIT group member  that  disposes  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  will exclude any resulting gain or loss from the computation of its preliminary tax result and the BEFIT group member that acquires the assets and liabilities will determine its preliminary tax result, in that fiscal year and the following fiscal years, by using the value for tax purposes, as it stands at the time of the transfer and as it is defined under article 4 of the Merger Directive."
2a14e340-0ae2-47c3-bd7d-31fe26152d9c,{'label': 'Anti-abuse'},"The Directive allows Member States to deny the benefits of the Directive where the reorganization has as its principal objective, or as one of its principal objectives, tax evasion or tax avoidance. The fact that a transaction is not carried out for valid commercial reasons may constitute a presumption that the transaction has tax evasion or avoidance as one of its principal objectives. Due to the general nature of this anti-abuse clause, many Member  States  have  introduced  additional  anti-abuse provisions in their domestic laws. As Member States hold different views on what is abusive, this has led to referrals to the ECJ, which was asked to decide whether such additional domestic conditions are in line with the Directive. General rules that automatically exclude certain categories of operations from the benefits of the Directive on the basis  of  general  criteria  -  e.g.  the  acquiring  company does  not  carry  on  business  by  itself;  the  same  person wholly  owns  all  companies  involved;  or  there  is  no joining  of  businesses  -  irrespective  of  whether  tax evasion or tax avoidance takes place, go further than necessary for preventing tax evasion or tax avoidance and undermine  the  aim  pursued  by  the  Directive.  None  of these criteria can be considered decisive on their own see Leur-Bloem (Case C-28/95). Where the motive for a transaction is solely tax based, the benefits of the Directive may not be obtained, as 'a valid commercial reason' is a concept involving more than the attainment of a purely fiscal advantage see Leur-Bloem (Case  C-28/95).  In  addition,  if  more  objectives  are involved, tax objectives may not be predominant. In this context, a valid commercial reason is not present where the cost savings resulting from restructurings and rationalizations are marginal compared to the level of tax benefits  (e.g.  the  use  of  tax  losses  incurred  by  the  merged company) see Foggia (Case C-126/10). However, it is not abusive under EU legislation to structure  the  transaction  in  the  most  tax-beneficial  way  if sound commercial reasons are available see Eurowings (Case C-294/97). Nevertheless,  the  benefits  of  the  Directive  may  not  be denied if the main purpose of a merger is the avoidance of a tax that is not covered by the Directive. In this sense, the anti-abuse rule does not cover transactions which, although primarily undertaken for tax purposes, aim at avoiding a tax that does not fall within the scope of the Directive  see  Zwijnenburg  v.  Staatssecretaris  van FinanciÃ«n (Case C-352/08). Cross-border reorganizations may lead to cases of double taxation where one Member State considers a transaction legitimate  (therefore  allowing  the  transaction  to  take place based on book values), while another Member State considers  the  same  transaction  abusive  (as  a  result  of which a deferral of tax is not granted). Under such circumstances, the applicable tax treaty (if any) or the Arbitration  Convention  (90/436)  may  oblige  the  Member States concerned to avoid the double taxation."

Member  States  can  allow  a  full deduction of interest expenses for standalone entities. The  net borrowing  costs are equal to the interest expenses, economically equivalent costs and costs incurred  for  the  raising  of  finance  less  taxable  interest income and economically equivalent income. Member States may allow companies belonging to a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes to calculate  their deductible  expenses  using  group  ratios. Accordingly, companies showing that their equity over asset ratio is equal to or higher than the equivalent group ratio may also fully deduct the interest. This is deemed to be the case if the equity over asset ratio is not more than 2%  lower  than  the  equivalent  ratio  of  the  worldwide group and all assets and liabilities are valued using the same method. Alternatively, Member States may allow a higher deduction calculated in two steps. First, the group ratio must be determined  by  dividing  the  excess  borrowing  costs towards third parties by the group EBITDA. Thereafter, the group ratio must be multiplied with the EBITDA of the company concerned. With respect to non-deductible interests, Member States may introduce carry-forward and carry-back possibilities for an unlimited period or a maximum of 3 years, respectively. With respect to unused interest capacity, Member States can also opt to implement a carry-forward provision for a maximum of 5 years. Member States may exclude financial undertakings from the scope of these rules, even where such financial undertakings  are  part  of  a  consolidated  group  for  financial accounting purposes. Excess interest expenses incurred on loans which were concluded before 17 June 2016 and loans used to fund certain long-term public infrastructure projects can also be excluded.

Through the use of objective indicators related to income, personnel and premises, the proposed directive aims to establish transparency standards in relation to the use of shell entities, in order to allow tax authorities to detect and prevent misuse of such entities for tax purposes and deny them certain tax benefits. As an advisory body in this procedure, the European Parliament  adopted  its  report  on  ATAD  3  proposal  on  17 January 2023 (COM(2021)0565 C9-0041/2022 -2021/0434(CNS))). The report is not legally binding for the ECOFIN but it should be taken into account while discussing and voting on the proposal."

The  Minimum  Taxation  Directive  was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on  22  December  2022  (ST/8778/2022/INIT,  OJ  L328 (2022)). The  Minimum  Taxation  Directive  aims  to  ensure  that large groups in the European Union pay a minimum tax rate in every jurisdiction in which they operate. It provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15% for domestic  and  international  groups  with  a  consolidated  group revenue of more than EUR 750 million a year during two of  the  last  four  tax  periods,  and  with  either  a  parent company or a subsidiary situated in an EU Member State. If the group is not taxed at such a minimum effective rate on a jurisdictional basis, a top-up tax is triggered to reach the 15% minimum effective tax rate."

The ETR is calculated  as  the  ratio  of  the  aggregate  amount  of  covered taxes  paid  in  a  jurisdiction  to  the  aggregate  amount  of qualifying  income  in  each  jurisdiction.  The  amount  of qualifying income is based on consolidated accounting results, as a starting point, with specific GloBE adjustments (e.g. exclusion of dividends from certain portfolios, timing differences, exclusion of shipping income). In the application of a substance-based carve-out, the calculation of qualifying income is reduced by an amount equal  to  5%  of  the  value  of  tangible  assets  and  5%  of payroll that the group employs in the jurisdiction (with a 10-year transitory regime with increased carve-out percentages). The amount of covered taxes does not include indirect taxes, payroll and property taxes. It is calculated from the accounting tax expense with specific GloBE adjustments."

Domestic groups can also be excluded for a transitional period of 5 years under the same conditions. The  rules  also  provide  for  an  exclusion  of  minimal amounts  of  income  to  reduce  the  compliance  burden. According to the de minimis exclusion, no top-up tax will be charged when average revenues are less than EUR 10 million and an average qualifying income (or loss) is less than EUR 1 million in a jurisdiction. Additionally, Member States in which very few groups are headquartered (i.e. less than 12 ultimate parent entities  of  groups  within  the  scope  of  this  directive  are located in the jurisdiction) have the option to not apply the IIR and the UTPR for 6 years. The election for the delayed application of the rules must be notified to the European Commission by 31 December 2023.

The  OECD  continues  working  on  the  implementation package.  On  15  December  2022,  the  Inclusive  Framework  on  BEPS  agreed  on  a  minimum  transitional  safe harbour  based  on  the  CbC  reporting  information  to exclude operations in lower-taxed jurisdictions provided that  in  the  jurisdiction  (i)  the de  minimis exclusion applies; (ii) the ETR (calculated on a simplified basis) is at least 15% (16% for 2025 and 17% for 2026); or (iii) the pre-tax profit is less than the amount resulting from the substance-based exclusion. A transitional penalty relief regime,  which  requires  careful  consideration  by  tax authorities for applying penalties or sanctions where an MNE has taken reasonable measures to ensure the correct application  of  the  GloBE  rules,  was  also  approved. Together  with  this  publication,  the  OECD  launched  a public consultation on the GloBE Information Return and dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms which ran until 3 February 2023.

Debt-equity bias reduction allowance'},"The Commission, as part of its business tax agenda for the 21st century for 2021-2023 (COM(2021) 251 final), launched an initiative to address the debt-equity bias in corporate taxation through a debt-equity bias reduction allowance (DEBRA) (i.e. an equity allowance). To this end,  the  Commission  issued  a  proposal  for  a  Council directive  on  11  May  2022  (COM(2022)  216  final)  and opened a feedback period which ran from 13 May until 8 July 2022. In short, the DEBRA initiative proposes: The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) has recommended to include an exclusion from the rules for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and micro-enterprises on the grounds that the proposed measures could make EU companies financially weaker and hamper investment, growth and job creation in the European Union (ECO/595-EESC-2022). The ECOFIN suspended work on DEBRA in light of the many interlinkages with other corporate tax dossiers, e.g. ATAD 3 ( see section 3.5.), the Minimum Taxation Directive ( see section 3.6.) and BEFIT ( see section 3.8.), which were  under  discussion  in  the  Council  or  had  been announced by the Commission ( see Report to the European Council on tax issues (14905/22 LIMITE FISC 227 ECOFIN 1177), as approved on 6 December 2022). Nevertheless, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) continued to exchange views on this proposal with the purpose of reaching a general Parliament opinion ( see COM(2022) 216 final). On 28 November 2023, MEPs of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON Committee) approved its report that was adopted by plenary session on  16  January  2024  (2022/0154(CNS).

Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT)'},"On  12  September  2023,  the  European  Commission launched a proposal to develop a common corporate tax framework  in  the  internal  market  (COM(2023)  532 final). This Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation  (BEFIT)  proposal  replaced  the  Commission's Common Corporate Tax Base and Common Consolidated Corporate  Tax  Base  proposals,  which  were  withdrawn ( see previous versions of the chapter). The BEFIT proposal aims to implement a common corporate tax framework for EU large-scale groups of companies, which would replace the 27 national systems. The proposal establishes a common set of rules to determine the tax base of companies that are part of a group that prepares consolidated financial statements and are subject to corporate income tax in a Member State. If the proposal is adopted  by  the  Council,  Member  States  will  have  to implement  the  BEFIT  into  their  national  laws  by  1 January 2028 and the new rules will apply from 1 July 2028. Together with the BEFIT proposal, the European Commission proposed a Council directive establishing a Head Office  Tax  system  for  micro,  small  and  medium  sized enterprises, and amending Directive 2011/16/EU (HOT) (COM(2023) 528 final) and a transfer pricing directive the  Council  directive  on  transfer  pricing  (COM(2023) 529 final) - to harmonize minimum standards. For details on the latter, see section 7. On 4 December 2023, MEPs of the ECON Committee discussed the draft report on the BEFIT proposal (2023/0321(CNS)). The draft report is scheduled to be voted on on 22 February 2024 for the BEFIT proposal (indicative date)."
604bbbc4-70df-45bd-8756-b062ee4860a8,{'label': 'Scope'},"The BEFIT rules foresee a hybrid scope. On one side, a mandatory scope comprises (domestic and multinational) groups  which  (i)  prepare  consolidated  financial  statements, (ii) had annual combined revenues of at least 750 million in at least 2 of the preceding 4 fiscal years and (iii) the ultimate parent entity holds at least 75% of the ownership rights or the rights giving entitlement to profit. Additionally,  if  the  group  is  headquartered  outside  the European Union, the EU sub-set will need to additionally raise at least 5% of group revenues in the European Union or the amount of EUR 50 million annual combined revenues in at least 2 of the preceding 4 fiscal years. In-scope groups include the entities that meet the 75% ownership framework. On the other side, a voluntary scope comprises smaller groups  that  prepare  consolidated  financial  statements. When a group opts in for this regime, the BEFIT rules apply  to  all  EU  entities  and  permanent  establishments that meet the ownership threshold of 75%. In this case, they are bound for a minimum period of 5 years. Although the rules would cover all sectors, certain sectorspecific characteristics are included, such as a carve-out from the BEFIT tax base (which is discussed below) for shipping  income  covered  by  a  national  tonnage  tax regime.
